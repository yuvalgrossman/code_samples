## - [Magnetic Field Control System](Magnetic_Field_Control_System)
  An app I wrote to set and control the magnetic field within a set of coils (termed "Helmholtz coil") and a magnetometer. 
  Built in matlab's app designer tool. 
  The essence of the software is a control loop between the two devices and can be found in the function [**setMagneticField**](/iceMag/Magnetic_Field_Control_System/MATLAB_functions/setMagneticField.m). 
  An app [screenshot](/iceMag/Magnetic_Field_Control_System/ScreenCapture.PNG) is also attached. 

## - [Circular_Standard_Deviation](Circular_Standard_Deviation.ipynb)
  How to measure the error of measured direction in the space? A jupyter notebook.

## - [Missing mass](compare_mass_susc.pdf)
  A way to deal with a problem I bounced into during the results analysis. A matlab livescript notebook.
