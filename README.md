# code_samples
Sample codes from several projects I have worked on: 
- SpaceIL Landing Site Selection

  A project I did mainly before my Master's degree at Weizmann Institute, and kept update until the Lunar "non-soft" landing :alien: on April 2019. 
  I present here two aspects of the project (**matlab** codes). 

- Magnetization of Dusty Ice Deposits

  My Master's thesis. This project involved lab experiments and modelling. 
  Without too many details, I present here an app I developed to control several lab instruments (**matlab app designer**), 
  as well as two notebooks (**matlab** and **python**) which show how I tried to solve some issues regarding the analysis of the experiments' results. 
  
  (hopefully I will also upload soon some parts of the model)

- General Utilities I wrote which I use frequently in my work
